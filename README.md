# tictactoe-bootcamp
Working space for tic-tac-toe bootcamp project
This was an excerise that was done through MITx Pro coding bootcamp that useses React hooks and custom compenents to create 
a fun and easy game that everyone know tic tac toe

Future roadmaps for this game would be to add an AI so there can be am option where just one person is playing vs the CPU
// You can find a script online that would use the computers CPU to make decisions that are based on the best possbile outcome for the CPU
so in other words. Give the computer the conditions that are necessary to make it the winner in the game and then tell the script to find the 
option with the least amount of moves to achieve the desired output to win the game. This would make the game less boring and quite challeneging. 

another interesting feature would be to use a social media post API so you can share your scores with your friends once you won! 
//This could be achieved by going into metas dev tools and access the API that allows a web applicaiton to share with facebook. 
This would require the user to sign into their meta account and verify their credientials. (Would give the app some added security anyways)
We can then create another component all together that could handle user athentication and at the end of the game when the criteria for 
...Gamestate is met we can use the data inside that compenent to share on social media!
